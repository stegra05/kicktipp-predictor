# Model Fix Summary - Critical Issues Resolved

## 🚨 Problems Identified

From your evaluation (0.98 ppm, 69% 0-0 predictions):
1. **Massive 0-0 over-prediction** (69% vs 5.3% actual)
2. **Away win catastrophic failure** (0.15 pts, 7.7% accuracy)
3. **Draw bias** causing overall poor performance
4. **Conservative model** under-predicting goals by ~1.5x

## ✅ All Fixes Implemented (4 Phases Complete)

### Phase 1: Emergency Fixes ⚡
**CRITICAL - Addresses 0-0 crisis immediately**

1. **Lambda Clamping Fixed** (`hybrid_predictor.py:29`)
   - Changed: `min_lambda = 0.25` → `0.05`
   - Why: 0.25 made Poisson(0.25) peak at 0 goals (77% probability)
   - Impact: Should reduce 0-0s from 69% to ~10-15%

2. **Probability Blend Rebalanced** (`hybrid_predictor.py:25`)
   - Changed: `prob_blend_alpha = 0.65` → `0.45`
   - Why: ML classifier better at discriminating outcomes (especially away wins)
   - Impact: Gives ML 55% weight vs 45% Poisson (was 35%/65%)

3. **Default Strategy Changed** (`predict.py:37`, `app.py:55`)
   - Changed: Default `'balanced'` → `'safe'`
   - Why: Safe strategy got 1.531 ppm vs 0.980 (56% better!)
   - Impact: Immediate 0.5+ ppm improvement

### Phase 2: Calibration & Distribution Fixes 🎯

4. **Temperature Scaling Added** (`hybrid_predictor.py:33, 89-90`)
   - Added: `goal_temperature = 1.3` parameter
   - Applied after lambda calculation: `lambda *= temperature`
   - Why: Scales goals up to match observed rates (~1.5-2.0 goals/side)
   - Impact: Aligns predicted with actual goal distributions

5. **Result Classifier Bias Fixed** (`ml_model.py:108-127`)
   - Added: Class weights using `compute_class_weight('balanced')`
   - Applied as sample weights in XGBClassifier training
   - Why: Combats draw over-prediction, boosts away win recognition
   - Impact: Balanced outcome predictions (especially away wins)

6. **Goal Distribution Validation** (`train_model.py:74-110`)
   - Added: Automatic validation after training
   - Shows: Actual vs predicted goal means
   - Warns if mismatch > 15%
   - Impact: Catches calibration issues early

### Phase 3: Points Optimization 🎲

7. **Expected Points Optimizer** (`hybrid_predictor.py:212-257`)
   - Added: `_calculate_expected_points(grid)` method
   - Calculates: E[points] for each scoreline considering all outcomes
   - Formula: `4*P(exact) + 3*P(diff) + 2*P(result)`
   - Impact: Foundation for future expected-value optimization

8. **Confidence-Adaptive Strategy** (`hybrid_predictor.py:324-342`)
   - Added: `use_confidence_adaptive` parameter
   - Logic: Low confidence (<0.4) → automatically use "safe" strategy
   - Why: Low-confidence predictions benefit from conservative approach
   - Impact: Improves overall consistency

### Phase 4: Diagnostics & Tools 📊

9. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Script** (`diagnose_model.py`)
   - Goal distribution analysis (predicted vs actual)
   - Scoreline analysis (top predicted vs actual)
   - Outcome distribution with confusion matrix
   - Confidence calibration by bins
   - Usage: `python diagnose_model.py`

10. **Updated Hyperparameter Tuning** (`tune_hyperparameters.py`)
    - Added: `goal_temperature` to grid search
    - Updated: Parameter ranges based on Phase 1-3 fixes
    - Grid: 81 combinations (3×3×3×3)
    - Usage: `python tune_hyperparameters.py`

## 🚀 What to Do Next

### Step 1: Retrain Models (REQUIRED)
```bash
python train_model.py
```
- New parameters require retraining
- Watch for goal distribution validation at end
- Should see: predicted goals closer to actual (within 10-15%)

### Step 2: Evaluate Improvements
```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```
Compare with your previous results:
- **0-0s should drop**: 69% → 10-15%
- **Away wins should improve**: 0.15 pts → 0.4-0.6 pts
- **Overall points should rise**: 0.98 → 1.8-2.2 ppm

### Step 3: Run Diagnostics
```bash
python diagnose_model.py
```
Check:
- Goal distributions match actual
- Scoreline predictions are realistic
- Outcome distribution balanced (not draw-heavy)

### Step 4: Test Predictions
```bash
python predict.py --record
```
- Now uses "safe" strategy by default
- Check predictions look reasonable (not all 0-0!)
- Record for tracking

### Step 5: (Optional) Tune Hyperparameters
```bash
python tune_hyperparameters.py
```
- Find optimal parameters for your specific data
- Takes ~15-20 minutes (81 combinations)
- May add 0.1-0.2 ppm improvement

## 🔍 Quick Verification

After retraining, check these key metrics in `evaluate_model.py`:

| Metric | Before | Target After | Status |
|--------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 0-0 predictions | 69% | 8-15% | ✅ Should fix |
| Away win points | 0.15 | 0.4-0.6 | ✅ Should fix |
| Overall ppm | 0.98 | 1.8-2.2 | ✅ Should fix |
| Draw accuracy | 72.7% | 40-50% | ⚠️ Will decrease (intentional - was over-fit) |

Don't worry if draw accuracy decreases! It was artificially high because you were predicting draws for everything. Better to be balanced.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Still getting many 0-0s after retraining"
- Check: Goal distribution validation in training output
- If predicted goals still too low, increase `goal_temperature` (try 1.4 or 1.5)
- Run: `python diagnose_model.py` to see goal distributions

### "Away wins still poor"
- Check: Class weights in training output (should see weights printed)
- Run: `python diagnose_model.py` → Outcome Distribution
- If still imbalanced, reduce `prob_blend_alpha` further (try 0.35)

### "Performance not improved much"
- Verify: Retrained with new parameters (check model timestamp)
- Check: Using 'safe' strategy (default now)
- Try: `python tune_hyperparameters.py` for optimal params

## 📊 Understanding the Fixes

### Why was lambda clamping the problem?
```
Poisson(0.25) distribution:
  0 goals: 77.9%  ← Peak here!
  1 goals: 19.5%
  2 goals:  2.4%

Both teams at 0.25 → 0-0 dominates grid
Dixon-Coles increases P(0-0) further
Result: 69% 0-0 predictions
```

### Why change probability blend?
```
Old: 65% Poisson, 35% ML
- Poisson: conservative, draw-biased
- ML classifier: discriminative, learned patterns

New: 45% Poisson, 55% ML
- More weight to model that learned away wins exist
- Less weight to conservative statistical model
```

### Why temperature scaling?
```
Observed: ~1.5-2.0 goals per team
Model predicted: ~1.0-1.3 goals per team

Temperature 1.3:
  1.0 * 1.3 = 1.3 goals
  1.3 * 1.3 = 1.69 goals

Brings predictions into observed range
```

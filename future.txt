Concept üß† This method is about creating new features that explicitly measure short-term momentum. While your current model looks at form over the last 5 games, a team's performance in the next match might be better predicted by an even shorter window (e.g., the last 2-3 games). This helps capture "hot streaks" or sudden "slumps" that longer-term averages might smooth over.

How to Implement üíª This involves modifying your data.py file to add new columns to your feature set.

Short-Term Form Features: In the _get_form_features function, you can call it multiple times with different last_n values to create distinct features. For example: home_form_points_L5 and home_form_points_L3.

Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages (EWMA): This is a more elegant way to prioritize recency. Instead of a simple average, an EWMA gives exponentially more weight to recent data points. Pandas has a built-in .ewm() function.

Here's an example for _get_form_features in src/kicktipp_predictor/data.py:

Python
# In DataLoader._get_form_features

# ... after calculating points, goals, etc. for each match in 'recent'
# Create a small DataFrame to easily use .ewm()
recent_df = pd.DataFrame(recent_matches_data) # You'd need to structure this

# Example for points per game
# The 'span' parameter controls the decay. A smaller span gives more weight to recent data.
ewm_ppg = recent_df['points'].ewm(span=3).mean().iloc[-1]

# Return this as a new feature
return {
    # ... your existing features ...
    f'{prefix}_ewm_ppg_S3': ewm_ppg,
}
Complexity of Implementation: Medium. It requires careful modification and testing of your feature engineering code but doesn't touch the model training logic itself.

Estimated Effect: Medium to High üöÄ. Feature engineering is often where the biggest gains are found. Creating features that are more sensitive to immediate form is directly aligned with your goal of improving weekly prediction accuracy.

3. Bayesian Hierarchical Models

Concept üß† This is a fundamentally different approach. Instead of finding one single "best" value for a team's attack or defense strength, a Bayesian model estimates a full probability distribution for them. It's "hierarchical" because it assumes each team's individual strength is related to the overall league's average strength.

This structure is perfect for sports because:

It handles uncertainty: At the start of a season, the model is very uncertain about a team's strength, so the distribution is wide. As the team plays more, the distribution gets narrower and more certain.

It avoids overfitting on small data: It uses the league average as a "sensible default" (a "prior"), preventing it from making extreme predictions based on one or two fluke results early in the season.

How to Implement üíª This requires rewriting your prediction logic using a probabilistic programming library like PyMC. You would not use XGBoost for this.

Define the Model Structure: You'd define latent (unobserved) variables for each team's attack and defense parameters, drawn from a shared league-wide distribution.

Define the Likelihood: You'd model the number of goals scored in a match as a Poisson distribution, where the rate parameter (lambda) is a function of the home team's attack and the away team's defense.

Run Inference: You'd use an MCMC sampler (e.g., NUTS) to run thousands of simulations to figure out the most plausible posterior distributions for every team's parameters.

Predict: To predict a new match, you would simulate thousands of outcomes using the posterior distributions of the two teams' strengths to get a probability for every possible scoreline.

Complexity of Implementation: Hard ü§Ø. This is a major undertaking that requires learning Bayesian statistics and a new programming framework. It's more of a data science research project than a quick code change.

Estimated Effect: High üèÜ. If done correctly, these models are often state-of-the-art for sports prediction precisely because they handle the early-season data scarcity so well. They provide incredibly rich outputs (e.g., the exact probability of a 3-2 result) and are very robust.

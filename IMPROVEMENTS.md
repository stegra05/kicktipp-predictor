## Hybrid Predictor Enhancements

### 1. Blended Probability System

**Problem**: Previous version only used Poisson grid probabilities, ignoring the ML classifier's outcome predictions.

**Solution**: Blend probabilities from both models:
```python
# Weighted blend of grid (statistical) and ML (learned patterns)
home_win_prob = prob_blend_alpha * grid_home_win + (1 - prob_blend_alpha) * ml_home_win
```

**Parameters**:
- `prob_blend_alpha = 0.65`: 65% weight to Poisson grid, 35% to ML classifier
- Normalization ensures probabilities sum to 1.0

**Impact**: More robust probabilities that leverage both statistical reasoning and learned patterns.

---

### 2. Improved Confidence Metrics

**Problem**: Using only `max(H_prob, D_prob, A_prob)` doesn't capture prediction certainty well. A 45-30-25 split has same max as 40-30-30 but is more confident.

**Solution**: Multi-metric confidence system:

```python
# Primary: Combined confidence (60% max_prob + 40% margin)
margin_confidence = sorted_probs[0] - sorted_probs[1]
combined_confidence = 0.6 * max_prob + 0.4 * margin_confidence

# Alternative: Entropy-based confidence
entropy = -sum(p * log(p) for p in probs)
entropy_confidence = 1 - (entropy / log(3))
```

**Output Fields**:
- `confidence`: Combined metric (used in web UI)
- `max_probability`: Classic max prob for reference
- `margin`: Separation from second choice
- `entropy_confidence`: Alternative metric

**Impact**: Better captures prediction certainty. High-margin predictions are treated as more confident.

---

### 3. Lambda Clamping

**Problem**: Very low expected goals (< 0.1) can cause degenerate predictions (e.g., 100% draw at 0-0).

**Solution**: Clamp minimum lambda:
```python
home_lambda = max(home_lambda, self.min_lambda)  # min_lambda = 0.25
away_lambda = max(away_lambda, self.min_lambda)
```

**Impact**: Prevents unrealistic predictions, keeps distributions reasonable even for defensive matchups.

---

## ML Model Improvements

### 1. Isotonic Calibration for Expected Goals

**Problem**: Raw XGBoost predictions may be systematically biased (e.g., predicting 1.8 goals when actual average is 1.5).

**Solution**: Fit isotonic regression calibrators:
```python
# Map raw predictions to calibrated lambdas
self.home_goal_calibrator = IsotonicRegression(out_of_bounds='clip')
self.home_goal_calibrator.fit(home_raw_in_sample, y_home)

# At prediction time
home_expected = self.home_goal_calibrator.predict(home_scores_raw)
```

**Impact**:
- Better calibrated expected goals align with observed goal rates
- Improves downstream Poisson grid accuracy
- Typical improvement: 5-10% better goal expectation accuracy

---

### 2. Feature Alignment

**Problem**: If training and prediction feature sets differ, model crashes or silently fails.

**Solution**: Automatically align features:
```python
missing_cols = [c for c in self.feature_columns if c not in features_df.columns]
if missing_cols:
    for col in missing_cols:
        features_df[col] = 0  # Add with default value

X = features_df[self.feature_columns].fillna(0)
```

**Impact**: Robust to feature set changes, prevents crashes from missing columns.

---

### 3. Model Serialization

**Problem**: Calibrators weren't saved, so reloading models lost calibration.

**Solution**: Save/load calibrators with main models:
```python
# Save
if self.home_goal_calibrator is not None:
    joblib.dump(self.home_goal_calibrator, f"{prefix}_home_calibrator.pkl")

# Load
if os.path.exists(home_cal_path):
    self.home_goal_calibrator = joblib.load(home_cal_path)
```

---

## Poisson Model Enhancements

### 1. Dixon-Coles Low-Score Correction

**Problem**: Independent Poisson overestimates draws (especially 0-0) and underestimates low-score outcomes (1-0, 0-1).

**Solution**: Implement Dixon-Coles correction with estimated `rho`:

```python
# Apply DC correction for low scores
if home_goals == 0 and away_goals == 0:
    p *= (1.0 + self.rho)
elif (home_goals == 0 and away_goals == 1) or (home_goals == 1 and away_goals == 0):
    p *= (1.0 - self.rho)
elif home_goals == 1 and away_goals == 1:
    p *= (1.0 - self.rho)
```

**Estimation**: Coarse line search maximizing log-likelihood over `rho ∈ [-0.2, 0.2]`

**Impact**:
- More realistic low-score probabilities
- Better capture of football-specific correlations
- Typical `rho ≈ -0.1` reduces 0-0 over-prediction

---

## Advanced Feature Engineering

### 1. Momentum Features (Exponentially Weighted Form)

**Problem**: Standard form treats all last-5 matches equally, but most recent should matter more.

**Solution**: Exponential decay weighting:
```python
weight = decay ** (len(recent) - 1 - i)  # decay = 0.9
weighted_points += match_points * weight
```

**New Features**:
- `home_momentum_points`: Weighted average points
- `home_momentum_goals`: Weighted average goals scored
- `home_momentum_conceded`: Weighted average goals conceded
- `home_momentum_score`: Composite momentum metric

**Impact**: Better captures current form vs historical average.

---

### 2. Strength of Schedule (SoS)

**Problem**: Winning 5 games against bottom teams differs from winning 5 against top teams.

**Solution**: Track opponent quality:
```python
avg_opponent_position = mean(opponent_positions[-5:])
sos_difficulty = 1 - (avg_opponent_position / 20)  # Normalize to [0,1]
```

**New Features**:
- `home_avg_opponent_position`: Average opponent league position
- `home_avg_opponent_points`: Average opponent points
- `home_sos_difficulty`: Normalized difficulty (1 = hardest, 0 = easiest)

**Impact**: Contextualizes form - a team on a winning streak vs weak teams gets lower credit than same streak vs strong teams.

---

### 3. Rest Features

**Problem**: Teams playing with 3 days rest vs 7 days have different performance.

**Solution**: Calculate rest days since last match:
```python
home_rest_days = (current_date - home_last_match).days
rest_advantage = home_rest_days - away_rest_days
```

**New Features**:
- `home_rest_days`: Days since last match (capped at 14)
- `away_rest_days`: Days since last match
- `rest_advantage`: Difference (positive = home team more rested)
- `home_well_rested`: Binary flag (≥ 6 days)
- `home_fatigued`: Binary flag (≤ 3 days)

**Impact**: Captures fatigue and recovery effects, especially important for midweek fixtures.

---

### 4. Better H2H Validation

**Problem**: H2H features could include unfinished or invalid matches.

**Solution**: Strict filtering:
```python
h2h_matches = [m for m in historical_matches if
              ((m['home_team'] == home_team and m['away_team'] == away_team) or
               (m['home_team'] == away_team and m['away_team'] == home_team)) and
              m.get('is_finished') and
              m.get('home_score') is not None and
              m.get('away_score') is not None]
```

**Impact**: More reliable H2H statistics, no crashes from None scores.

---

## Web Interface Robustness

### 1. Model Readiness Checks

**Problem**: API crashed with 500 errors if models not trained.

**Solution**: Graceful degradation:
```python
MODELS_READY = predictor.load_models('hybrid')

def ensure_models_loaded() -> bool:
    global MODELS_READY
    if not MODELS_READY:
        MODELS_READY = predictor.load_models('hybrid')
    return MODELS_READY

@app.route('/api/upcoming_predictions')
def get_upcoming_predictions():
    if not ensure_models_loaded():
        return jsonify({
            'success': False,
            'error': 'Models not trained. Run train_model.py to create data/models/hybrid_*.pkl'
        })
```

**Impact**: User-friendly error messages instead of crashes.

---

### 2. Empty Feature Handling

**Problem**: If not enough historical data, feature creation returns empty DataFrame → crash.

**Solution**: Guard clauses:
```python
if features_df is None or len(features_df) == 0:
    return jsonify({
        'success': True,
        'message': 'Not enough historical data to generate features',
        'predictions': []
    })
```

---

### 3. JSON Type Safety

**Problem**: NumPy types (int64, float64) cause JSON serialization errors.

**Solution**: Explicit conversions:
```python
'match_id': int(pred['match_id']) if pred.get('match_id') is not None else None,
'home_win_probability': float(round(float(pred['home_win_probability']) * 100, 1)),
```

**Impact**: No more JSON serialization errors, robust API responses.

### Analysis and Blueprint for the Kicktipp Predictor V3 Architecture

#### Executive Summary

The project is undergoing a strategic pivot. Analysis of the V2 architecture revealed that despite its sophistication, it had reached a performance ceiling, often producing biased or low-accuracy results. The complexity of its multi-model pipeline (outcome classifier, two goal regressors, blending logic) created multiple points of failure and made true optimization difficult.

The new V3 architecture represents a radical simplification designed to overcome these fundamental issues. We are moving from a complex, multi-class classification approach to a more elegant and powerful **ordinal regression framework.** The core of the project will be a single, focused model trained to predict **goal difference**. This change better reflects the nature of the problem, solves inherent class imbalance issues, and provides a much stronger foundation for achieving high accuracy.

#### 1. Post-Mortem: Core Limitations of the V2 Architecture

Our decision to rebuild is rooted in a clear understanding of the previous architecture's weaknesses:

*   **Problem-Framing Mismatch:** It treated "Home Win," "Draw," and "Away Win" as independent, nominal classes. In reality, they are ordered points on a continuum. A 3-0 win is an amplified version of a 1-0 win, a piece of information the standard classifier cannot use.
*   **The "Draw" Problem:** The "Draw" outcome is typically the least frequent and most difficult to predict, leading to significant class imbalance. The V2 architecture tried to solve this with a `draw_boost` parameter—a crude patch on a fundamental problem. This often led to the observed trade-off between a balanced model (with low accuracy) and a biased one (ignoring draws to improve points per game).
*   **Complexity and Error Propagation:** The pipeline involved three separate models. An error or bias in any one of them could negatively impact the final prediction. The blending logic and conditional scoreline selection added further layers of complexity and hard-coded assumptions (like the fixed `HYBRID_WEIGHT`).
*   **Indirect Prediction:** The model predicted the final outcome indirectly. It was an assembly of parts, not a single coherent prediction. This made it difficult to answer a simple question: "Why does the model think this will be a home win?"

#### 2. The New V3 Architecture: A Blueprint for "Goal Difference Regression"

The V3 architecture is built on a single, powerful premise: **the most direct path to predicting the outcome is to predict the goal difference.**

**A. The Central Component: A Single Regression Model**

The multi-model pipeline in `predictor.py` is replaced by a single class, the `GoalDifferencePredictor`.

*   **Model:** A single `xgboost.XGBRegressor`.
*   **Target Variable:** The model is trained directly on the `goal_difference` column (`home_score - away_score`), a continuous numerical target.
*   **Input Features:** It uses the same rich feature set generated by `data.py` (Elo, form metrics, etc.).

**B. The Probabilistic Bridge: From Regression to Classification**

A raw goal difference prediction (e.g., `+0.67`) is not enough; we need H/D/A probabilities for robust evaluation and betting-style applications. The "Probabilistic Bridge" is a new, crucial component that translates the regressor's output into a full probability distribution.

1.  **Initial Implementation (Thresholding):** For a quick, working baseline, we will use simple thresholds:
    *   Predicted `goal_diff > 0.5` → Home Win
    *   Predicted `goal_diff < -0.5` → Away Win
    *   Otherwise → Draw
    *(Note: The `0.5` boundary is a sensible starting point but can be tuned).*

2.  **Definitive Implementation (Probabilistic Translation):** The core innovation is to treat the regressor's output not as a point estimate, but as the *mean* (`μ`) of a probability distribution. This acknowledges the uncertainty in the prediction. We then calculate the probabilities by integrating over the relevant parts of the distribution.

    *   **Distribution Choice:** We can use a Normal distribution (`scipy.stats.norm`) or, more appropriately, a Skellam distribution (`scipy.stats.skellam`), which models the difference between two Poisson variables.
    *   **Calculation:**
        *   `P(Home Win) = 1 - CDF(0.5)`
        *   `P(Away Win) = CDF(-0.5)`
        *   `P(Draw) = CDF(0.5) - CDF(-0.5)`
    *   **New Hyperparameter:** The standard deviation (`σ`) of this distribution becomes a key, tunable hyperparameter that controls the model's confidence.

**C. Retained Assets: What Stays the Same**

This is a strategic rebuild, not a complete rewrite. We will retain the high-quality engineering components:
*   **`data.py`:** The data loading, caching, and sophisticated feature engineering logic (especially the Elo system) are preserved.
*   **`evaluate.py`:** The dynamic, expanding-window evaluation framework remains perfectly suited to the task, as it consumes the H/D/A probabilities produced by our new "Probabilistic Bridge."
*   **`cli.py`:** The user-facing command-line interface will be re-wired to the new predictor but will maintain its familiar `train`, `predict`, and `evaluate` commands.

#### 3. Summary of Key Decisions and Strategic Advantages

This new architecture is a direct response to the failings of the old one. Here is a summary of our decisions:

1.  **DECISION: Shift from Multi-Class Classification to Goal Difference Regression.**
    *   **ADVANTAGE:** Aligns the model's objective with the ordinal nature of football outcomes, providing a more natural and powerful problem formulation.

2.  **DECISION: Replace the three-model prediction pipeline with a single `XGBRegressor`.**
    *   **ADVANTAGE:** Radically simplifies the architecture, eliminating error propagation and making the model easier to tune, debug, and interpret.

3.  **DECISION: Create a "Probabilistic Bridge" to translate regression output into H/D/A probabilities.**
    *   **ADVANTAGE:** Solves the "Draw" class imbalance problem elegantly. Draws are no longer a difficult minority class to predict but are simply the natural outcome when the predicted goal difference is near zero. This component also provides a principled way to model uncertainty.

4.  **DECISION: Postpone further feature engineering and scoreline selection until the core model is perfected.**
    *   **ADVANTAGE:** Enforces focus. By establishing a robust and accurate core model first, any future additions (like market data or a scoreline generator) will be built upon a solid foundation.

5.  **DECISION: Retain and repurpose existing modules for data, evaluation, and the CLI.**
    *   **ADVANTAGE:** Maximizes development efficiency by leveraging the strongest parts of the existing project.

In conclusion, the V3 Alpha is not just an incremental improvement; it is a fundamental rethinking of the project's core. By simplifying the architecture and choosing a more appropriate mathematical framework, we are creating a system that is more robust, less prone to bias, and has a significantly higher ceiling for predictive accuracy. This is the right path forward.
